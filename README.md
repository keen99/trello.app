Unofficial Trello.app
=====================

A simple, and experimental wrapper app for Mac OS X app for Trello using [node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit). Other than providing a status menu bar icon, it does little else.

To build your own, run:

    ./build.sh

which should give you a `Trello.app`.
